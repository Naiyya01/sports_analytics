IPL score predictor using ML model

under this project, I have used ipl_data.csv to predict the ipl score.
Machine learning models have been used to better prediction, then using steamlit app, I have created a basic webpage for predicting the score. 

to open this webapp:
open the anaconda prompt, and run streamlit to your local folder.
